This repository contains code forked from `https://github.com/jacobdavidson/bees_lifetimetracking_2018data`

It was originally used to produce figures for the following paper:  
Smith, M. L., Davidson, J. D., Wild, B., Dormagen, D. M., Landgraf, T., and Couzin, I. D. (2022). The dominant axes of lifetime behavioral variation in honey bees. Submitted

We are merging in some of this code to be used in the `honey-bee-behavior` project.
