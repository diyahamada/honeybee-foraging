Info about the comb contentsColors denote the different comb areasGreen – empty combBlue – broodDark blue – capped brood (we can/should probably just group all brood into one group)Yellow – honeyOrange – pollenGrey – peripheral galleriesBrown – wooden framesPink circles – dances observed during tracing (the general area is the dancefloor)For the file names, there are a couple things:“startXX” where XX is a number starting with 00.  They’re in order of recordings.  “_XXX_XXX_” where each XXX is a number, denotes which camera, and so lets you know which side of the comb you’re on.  The entrance side of the colony is recorded by cameras 680 and 674 (680 is the top half of the obs hive, 674 is the bottom half of the obs hive).  220 and 219 is the non-entrance side of the colony (220 is top half, 219 is bottom half).  “16July” Seems pretty straightforward, but that’s the date that the comb contents were traced out.  So, if you have a file called: “start04_220_219_05Aug”It’s the comb contents at the beginning of the “start04” recording, 220_219 lets us know it’s the non-entrance side, 05Aug tells us the date. IMPORTANT:   	220_219 is camera 1		680_674 is camera 0This is REVERSE order19 March 2020:MLS adds last two images, warped to match with cam position (as all others are). Warping done on MLS laptop, notebook: Match_comb_layers_to_stitched_imagesThey're both "start12" because the last image is for the end of recording for 20182021:added .pkl files for each day, in order to speed up and simplify working with the comb data in Python
